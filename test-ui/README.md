## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to analyze email"**: Make sure the backend server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Empty results**: Check browser console for error messages
- **Slow analysis**: First analysis may be slower as ML models load into memory

## Purpose

This test UI is separate from the main frontend dashboard to allow:
- Quick testing of analysis functionality
- Beta testing without complexity
- Standalone demonstration of core features
- Development iteration without affecting main UI
