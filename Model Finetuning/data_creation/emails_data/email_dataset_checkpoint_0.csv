I am writing to you today not only as a resident of Northwick, but in my capacity as Manager of the Northwick Community Hub, to express my profound and increasingly urgent concerns regarding the current state of housing and planning within our constituency. While I appreciate the ongoing pressures for new housing, the recent trajectory of local development decisions has become a source of immense disappointment and genuine alarm for myself and the many families and individuals my organisation supports daily.

Specifically, the ongoing situation surrounding the proposed 'Willowbrook Fields' development, among others, feels emblematic of a worrying disconnect between genuine local needs and current planning policy outcomes. We are witnessing a proliferation of dwellings that are largely unaffordable for local families struggling with the cost of living, leading to an exodus of our younger generations and key workers. This unchecked expansion is placing unsustainable strain on our already overstretched local infrastructure – our GP surgeries have waiting lists spanning weeks, our schools are at capacity, and our roads are increasingly gridlocked. Furthermore, the relentless encroachment on our precious green spaces feels short-sighted and detrimental to the long-term well-being and environmental health of Northwick. This is not about being anti-development; it's about being pro-sustainable, pro-community development, which sadly, we are not currently seeing.

As a community leader, I see the very real, day-to-day impact of these decisions on our residents – from the mental health strain of housing insecurity to the erosion of community spirit as local people are priced out. My primary motivation, and indeed that of the Northwick Community Hub, is to find practical, sustainable solutions that genuinely benefit our constituency. I believe we must urgently re-evaluate how planning decisions are made and ensure that local voices, and genuinely affordable housing, are at the absolute heart of any new initiatives. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to meet with you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss how we might collaboratively advocate for stronger, more community-centric planning policies, both locally with the Council and potentially at a national level. Your role as our representative is crucial in ensuring Northwick's future is built on stability, not unsustainable growth.

Thank you for your time and consideration of these critical issues.

Yours sincerely,

Eleanor Vance
